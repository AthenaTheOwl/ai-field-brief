# .agents/CATALOG.md

The 50-role catalog from `../athena-site/ops/control-plane.md` plus
one speculative graduation (`product.subscriber-experience`). Nine
roles ship as worked examples under `.agents/roles/`; 42 of the
original 50 remain tracked here as `not-installed`. Promotion of a role off this
list and into `.agents/roles/<id>/` requires a PR that lands the role
file set (`role.yaml`, `instructions.md`, `tools.yaml`,
`output.schema.json`, `gates.yaml`) plus a DEC and a CATALOG entry
removal in the same commit.

## Graduated

- 2026-05-24 — `learning.skill-curator` graduated. Originating
  evidence: R-CDCP-007 (spec 0010 traceability) plus the two
  existing skills under `.agents/skills/install-cdcp-governance/`
  and `.agents/skills/run-weekly-brief/` that landed before the role
  existed.
- 2026-05-24 — `security.threat-modeler` graduated. Originating
  evidence: R-BOOT-006 (spec 0000 traceability) — tenant and audit
  tests had been routing to `engineering.implementation` for lack
  of a graduated owner.
- 2026-05-24 — `product.subscriber-experience` graduated
  (speculative). Originating evidence: the deployed site
  `ai-field-brief.vercel.app` has visitors right now, the two
  published briefs (2026-W20 and 2026-W21) under `briefs/`, and no
  other role owns the comprehension surface.
